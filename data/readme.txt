Then, open APK editor, and select your Miitomo app, either as an APK or from your installed apps
Select "Simple Edit (FILE REPLACEMENT)"
Click the save icon (the 2nd one) next to classes.dex

Save it somewhere you'll remember!

Now, open Unipatcher.
Select "MiifotoDex.xdelta" as the Patch file
Select the classes.dex file you extracted as the ROM file
Make output file something you'll remember (it can be anything!)

Now, click the save icon in the bottom right corner.

Next, return to APK editor.
Select the replace icon (the first one) next to classes.dex and find the patched file from the previous step
Then, go into assets, and select the replace icon next to npf.json
Replace it with the npf.json file you downloaded earlier.
Now, click Save at the bottom of your screen. Once it finsihes, click remove, then click install.

Now you should be good to go!
